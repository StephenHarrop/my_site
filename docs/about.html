<p style="word-wrap: break-word; word-break: break-all;">I'm currently a PhD candidate at Yale University. My dissertation is titled <i>Spinoza, Explained</i>, and my dissertation supervisor is Michael Della Rocca. Before coming to Yale I earned a B.A. in philosophy and mathematics and an M. A. in philosophy from The Johns Hopkins University. Before that, I spent two years at Austin Community College.</p>
