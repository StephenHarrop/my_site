</p>

<p>I'm currently a Visiting Assistant Professor at Texas A&amp;M University. In the past I held appointments at Mount Holyoke College and Connecticut College.</p>

<p>I got my PhD at Yale University. I defended a dissertation entitled <i>Spinoza, Explained</i> in 2022, under the supervision of Michael Della Rocca. Before landing at Yale I earned a BA in philosophy and mathematics and an MA in philosophy from The Johns Hopkins University. Before that, I spent two years at Austin Community College.</p>
