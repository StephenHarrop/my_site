1. "On the Necessity of Priority Monism." <i>Erkenntnis</i>. Forthcoming. <button class="collapsible">[abstract]</button>
<div class="content">
  <p><b>Abstract.</b> Priority monism is the doctrine that there is only one basic object: the entire cosmos. Priority monists often take this to be a metaphysically necessary thesis. I explore the consequences of modalizing the priority monist thesis. I argue that, modulo some assumptions, the modalized thesis entails the necessary existence of the actual cosmos. I further argue that, if the modalized thesis is true, and the actual cosmos necessarily exists, then the only possible concrete objects are the actually existing ones.

2. "Essence, Experiment, and Under-determination in the Spinonza-Boyle Correspondence." <i>HOPOS: The Journal of the International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science</i>. Forthcoming.<button class="collapsible">[abstract]</button>
<div class="content">
  <p><b>Abstract.</b> I examine the (mediated) correspondence between Spinoza and Robert Boyle concerning the latter’s account of fluidity and his experiments on reconstitution of niter in the light of the epistemology and doctrine of method contained in the <i>Treatise on the Emendation of the Intellect</i>. I argue that both the <i>Treatise</i> and the correspondence reveal that for Spinoza, the proper method of science is not experimental, and that he accepted a powerful under-determination thesis. I argue that, in contrast to modern versions, Spinoza’s form of naturalism was a highly rationalist and anti-empirical one. I conclude with a brief account of the value of experience and experimentation for Spinoza’s scientific method.

3. "Thomas Reid on Induction and Natural Kinds." <i>Journal of Scottish Philosophy</i> 20(1): 1-18. 2022. <button class="collapsible">[abstract]</button>
<div class="content">
  <p><b>Abstract.</b> I examine the views of Thomas Reid with respect to a certain version of the problem of induction: Why are inductions using natural kinds successful, and what justifies them? I argue that while both Reid holds a kind of conventionalist view about natural kinds, this conventionalism has a realistic component which allows him to answer both questions.

4. "On Some Leibnizian Arguments for the Principle of Sufficient Reason." <i>History of Philosophy Quarterly</i> 37(2): 143-162. 2020.
<button class="collapsible">[abstract]</button>
<div class="content">
  <p><b>Abstract.</b> Leibniz often refers to the Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) as something like a first principle. In some texts, however, he attempts to give positive arguments in its favor. I examine two such arguments, and find them wanting. The first argument has two defects. First, it is question-begging; and second, when the question-begging step is excised, the principle one can in fact derive is highly counter-intuitive. The second argument is valid, but has the defect of only reaching a nearly trivial conclusion.
