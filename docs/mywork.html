<p style="color:#003399;font-size:22px;font-weight:bold;text-align:left;">Stephen Harrop</a> > Research</p>

<p>My philosophical specialization is in the early modern continental rationalists (Spinoza and Leibniz, mainly), with primary interests in their metaphysics and philosophy of science.  I also have research interests in contemporary metaphysics and philosophy of science.</p>

<p>My main area of interest is <i>explanatory rationalism</i>, the view that every thing in a target area of inquiry has an explanation. This interest is both historical and contemporary. In historical philosophy, I'm interested both in arguments for this view and in the structure that such explanations would take according to Spinoza and Leibniz. In contemporary philosophy, I'm interested in giving arguments for the view, as well as in exploring the connection between explanatory rationalism and other contemporary metaphysical debates, such as the discourse surrounding the concept of grounding.</p>

<p> I also work on the philosophy of Emilie Du Ch&#226;telet, focusing on her philosophy of religion and science, as well as her metaphysics.</p>
