<p>I'm currently a PhD candidate at Yale University. My dissertation is titled <i>Spinoza, Explained</i>, and my dissertation supervisor is Michael Della Rocca. 
  Before coming to Yale I earned a B.A. in philosophy and mathematics and an M. A. in philosophy from The Johns Hopkins University. 
  Before that, I spent two years at Austin Community College.</p>

<p>Starting fall 2022, I'll be a Lecturer in the Department of Philosophy at Mount Holyoke College.</p>
